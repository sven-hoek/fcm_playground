A simple environment to test and play with a Fuzzy-C-Means algorithm and 2D-Data

You can add data points per mouseclick, remove them with right mouseclick, save and load created datasets. Meant to be a simple exercise to learn Python, matplotlib and tkinter but also to try out implementing an algorithm like Fuzyy C-Means and play with it. Therefore, the code structure is not (yet?) optimal, it's not too easily extendable to n-dimensional datasets and may be a little buggy.
