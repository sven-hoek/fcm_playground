A simple environment to test and play with a Fuzzy-C-Means algorithm and 2D-Data

You can add data points per mouseclick, remove them with right mouseclick, save and load created datasets. This is supposed to be not more than just an exercise to learn python, matplotlib and tkinter but also to try out implementing an algorithm like Fuzyy C-Means and play with it. Therefore, the code structure is not (yet?) optimal, it's not too easily extendable to n-dimensional datasets and may be a little buggy.
